    <h5>_The Hall of Justice_ (31 _minutes_).</h5>
    <h4>_The Court of Justice_: _the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet_:
        _above the hangings the wall is red_, _and gilt symbolical figures bear
        up the roof_, _which is made of red beams with grey soffits and
        moulding_: _a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the
        Duchess_: _below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges_: _below
        that a table for the clerks of the court. Two soldiers stand on each
        side of the canopy_, _and two soldiers guard the door_; _the citizens
        have some of them collected in the Court_; _others are coming in greeting
        one another_; _two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands_.</h4>

    <b> FIRST CITIZEN </b><br>

    <p>Good morrow, neighbour Anthony.</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

    <p>Good morrow, neighbour Dominick.</p><br>

    <b> FIRST CITIZEN </b><br>

    <p>This is a strange day for Padua, is it not?—the Duke being dead.</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

    <p>I tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since the
    last Duke died.</p><br>

    <b> FIRST CITIZEN </b><br>

    <p>They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,
    neighbour Anthony?</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

   <p> Nay, for he might ’scape his punishment then; but they will condemn
    him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards
    so that no injustice is done.</p><br>

    <b> FIRST CITIZEN </b><br>

    <p>Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not.</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

    <p>Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke’s blood.</p><br>

    <b><b>THIRD CITIZEN</b><br></b><br>

   <p> They say a Duke has blue blood.</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

   <p> I think our Duke’s blood was black like his soul.</p><br>

    <b> FIRST CITIZEN </b><br>

   <p> Have a watch, neighbour Anthony, the officer is looking at thee.</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

    <p>I care not if he does but look at me; he cannot whip me with the
    lashes of his eye.</p><br>

    <b>THIRD CITIZEN</b><br>

   <p> What think you of this young man who stuck the knife into the Duke?</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

    <p>Why, that he is a well-behaved, and a well-meaning, and a
    well-favoured lad, and yet wicked in that he killed the Duke.</p><br>

    <b>THIRD CITIZEN</b><br>

   <p> ’Twas the first time he did it: may be the law will not be hard on
    him, as he did not do it before.</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

    <p>True.</p><br>

    <b>TIPSTAFF</b>

    <p>Silence, knave.</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

    <p>Am I thy looking-glass, Master Tipstaff, that thou callest me knave?</p><br>

    <b> FIRST CITIZEN </b><br>

   <p> Here be one of the household coming. Well, Dame Lucy, thou art of the
    Court, how does thy poor mistress the Duchess, with her sweet face?</p><br>

    <b>MISTRESS LUCY</b>

    <p>O well-a-day! O miserable day! O day! O misery! Why it is just
    nineteen years last June, at Michaelmas, since I was married to my
    husband, and it is August now, and here is the Duke murdered; there is
    a coincidence for you!</p><br>

    <b>SECOND CITIZEN</b><br>

   <p> Why, if it is a coincidence, they may not kill the young man: there is
    no law against coincidences.</p><br>

    <b> FIRST CITIZEN </b><br>

   <p> But how does the Duchess?</p><br>
