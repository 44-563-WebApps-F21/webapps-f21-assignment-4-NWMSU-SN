    <p class="speech">Well well, I knew some harm would happen to the house: six weeks ago
        the cakes were all burned on one side, and last Saint Martin even as
        ever was, there flew into the candle a big moth that had wings, and
        a’most scared me.</p>

    <p class="speech"></p>But come to the Duchess, good gossip: what of her?</p>

    <b class="mistress-lucy">MISTRESS LUCY</b>

    <p class="speech"></p>Marry, it is time you should ask after her, poor lady; she is
    distraught almost. Why, she has not slept, but paced the chamber all
    night long. I prayed her to have a posset, or some aqua-vitæ, and to
    get to bed and sleep a little for her health’s sake, but she answered
    me she was afraid she might dream. That was a strange answer, was it
    not?</p>

    <p class="speech"></p>These great folk have not much sense, so Providence makes it up to
    them in fine clothes.</p>

    <p class="speech"></p>Well, well, God keep murder from us, I say, as long as we are alive.
